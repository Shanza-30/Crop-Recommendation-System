## 🌱 Input Parameters

The model analyzes the following key features:

### 🧪 Soil Nutrients

* Nitrogen (N)
* Phosphorus (P)
* Potassium (K)
* Soil pH value

### 🌦️ Climatic Factors

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Rainfall

These parameters play a crucial role in determining crop suitability.


## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. **User Input**
   Users provide soil and climate values using an intuitive **slider-based interface**.

2. **Data Scaling**
   Input values are normalized using a **pre-trained scaler** to match the model’s training format.

3. **Prediction**
   The trained machine learning model predicts the **most suitable crop** based on the given inputs.

4. **Output & Transparency**

   * Recommended crop is displayed instantly
   * Optional technical details (scaled inputs, prediction indices) are shown for learning and debugging
